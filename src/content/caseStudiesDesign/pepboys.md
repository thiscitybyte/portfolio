  Pep Boys asked us to create a budget-friendly holiday game, and we delivered a tiered mascot match experience that rewarded repeat plays with bigger discounts. I led concepting, designed the mobile UI/UX, built wireframes, and worked closely with the developer to ensure the animations, pacing, and style hit the mark.

aboutProject:
  leftCol: >
    <p>Pep Boys came to us with the ask to create a holiday game experience. Due to budget constraints we knew we weren't going to build the Grand Turismo PS4 game we all envisioned. After some concepting we landed upon the idea of a match game. Using the Pep Boys mascots (and owners) we created a three tiered game (easy, medium, hard) that could be played multiple times to receive higher discounts on Pep Boys offerings each time. For this job I led brainstorms, created the UI/UX wireframes and designed out the game for mobile. I also was tasked to ensure the animations, pacing and style of the game was embraced and understood by the developer building the front and back end of the experience.</p>
