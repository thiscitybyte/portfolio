  I pitched the “Marry, Dump, Date” game and Lifeguard Cutout photo op—both became centerpieces of the experience. I also designed and coded the responsive tablet tool that brought it all to life.

aboutProject:
  leftCol: >
    <p>I led my team through the full brainstorming and ideation process for the campaign’s interactive experiences, ensuring we landed on concepts that were fun, on-brand, and highly shareable. Two of the biggest crowd-pleasers—the cheeky “Marry, Dump, Date” game and the playful Lifeguard Cutout photo op—were ideas I developed as central pillars of the activation. In addition to creative direction, I designed the tablet interface that powered the on-site engagement and handled all the front-end coding for a fully responsive, polished experience. The end result was an activation that blended creativity, humor, and solid technical execution to keep participants entertained and engaged.</p>
