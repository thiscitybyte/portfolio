title: Sauza | Lasso Up A Cowboy
description: >-
  “Lasso Up a Cowboy” was an award-winning dual-screen experience for Sauza. I led design and dev coordination, using WebSocket tech to let users flick lassos from their phones to an iPad for a chance to win prizes at tasting events.

aboutProject:
  leftCol: >
    <p>With the success of the the prior years "Make It With A Lifeguard" my team and I brainstormed how we could take that experience further. The end result was "Lasso Up A Cowboy" dual screen experience. The way this experience worked was that the Sauza street team would set up an iPad at the tasting footprints. Users could text in to receive lasso's on their phone which paired with the iPad. You could then flick the lasso from your phone to the screen of the iPad to try and win a prize (a mobile coupon for Sauza Sparkling Margarita). I was the lead designer on this project as well as the go between the creative team and the developers to explain how we would utilize websocket technology to make this game a success! Really fun project for all involved as well as receiving multiple awards for top mobile web experience of 2016.</p>
