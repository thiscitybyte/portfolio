title: Redbox | Days of Deals
description: >-
  Redbox challenged us to rethink their “Days of Deals” promo. I designed and built a swipeable CSS3 box that revealed daily prizes, replacing their static SMS approach. The interactive experience drove a notable spike in user engagement and repeat visits.

aboutProject:
  leftCol: >
    <p>Tasked by Redbox to create a daily mobile "Days of Deals" that would reveal codes to win free rentals. Myself and team ideated on how the box would work on mobile. We wanted to create a quick experience that provided suprise and delight. Users texted in daily for 10 days to get a chance to spin the box and be rewarded with codes or a prize. I was tasked with prototyping and eventually building the pure CSS3 "box" that spun when the user swiped. Redbox saw a huge jump in returning customers during the ten days of deals as compared to thier original method which was puretly just a SMS message with the code.</p>
