aboutProject:
  leftCol: >
    <p>Verizon approached the team wanting to improve the way the receive customer satisfaction. The resulting experience was a swipeable mobile experience that allowed you to answer the questions by choosing a spectrum of the smile emoji at full smile, semi-smile, blank smile and frown. At the end of the survey the user was randomly given a chance to win a prize. I came up with the idea for this and built a simple prototype in Figma to show the interaction, however, the client never went forward with implementing it.</p>

clientFeedback:
  - blockquote: 'We were genuinely impressed by the creative direction and innovative thinking behind the emoji-based satisfaction concept. It was fresh, intuitive, and aligned perfectly with how we wanted to modernize our customer experience. If budget hadn’t been a constraint, we would’ve loved to see it brought to life.'
